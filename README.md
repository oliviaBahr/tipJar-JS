# tipJar

### welcome to tipJar!
<br>

you know those random bits of information you come across that you feel like you'll probably want at some point in the future but you have no idea where to put them?
do you have a bunch of three line txt files cluttering your desktop with no way to search through them?

this is a place where you can store useful links, helpful life hacks, cool quotes, and random bits of information you have nowhere to put... a.k.a tips!

<br>

this is an indie project (that's pretty obvious) done only by me. contributions are welcome! please see issues if you're interested in helping my noble cause.

<br>
<br>
the beta will be published with npm very soon!
