# welcome to tipJar!

you know those random bits of information you come across that you feel like you'll probably want at some point in the future but you have no idea where to put them?\
do you have a bunch of three line txt files cluttering your desktop with no way to search through them?

#### this is a place where you can store useful links, helpful life hacks, cool quotes, and random bits of information you have nowhere to put... a.k.a tips!
it runs directly in a terminal window so you can feel like a hacker even though you're probably not.

<br>

this is an indie project done only by me. contributions are welcome! please see issues if you're interested in helping my noble cause.\
please use lower case only (because this is cool people repo).
<br>
<br>
#### the beta will be published with npm very soon!

for now, navigate to the folder then run ```node controller.mjs``` to start the program.\
here are the dependencies you need
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed)
- [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/)

<br>

blessed is the main dependency for this project. its last commit was in 2016, so if it randomly stops working it's not my fault!

### info about spacing

blessed works with terminal rows and columns for spacing. this means that if your terminal is too big or too small the spacing of buttons and boxes will be weird.\
i'm currently working on a way to adjust the spacing based on terminal size so it will always look good.\
for now, just resize your terminal window and the spacing will dynamically update.
